# Learning Day 1: Starting My Coding Journey

Today marks the beginning of my documented learning journey! I'm excited to share my progress, challenges, and discoveries as I dive deeper into web development.

## What I Learned Today

### Setting Up My Environment

First things first - I got my development environment properly configured:

- ✅ Installed VS Code with essential extensions
- ✅ Set up Node.js (v20 LTS)
- ✅ Configured Git for version control
- ✅ Created my first Next.js project

### Key Takeaways

1. **Start small, but start now** - It's better to make small progress every day than to wait for the "perfect" moment.

2. **Document everything** - Writing about what I learn helps reinforce the concepts.

3. **Embrace the confusion** - Not understanding something immediately is part of the process.

## Challenges I Faced

The biggest challenge today was understanding the difference between:

- `npm install` vs `npm install -D`
- `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`

After some research, I learned that:

> **dependencies** are packages required for the app to run in production, while **devDependencies** are only needed during development (like testing frameworks or build tools).

## Tomorrow's Goals

- [ ] Learn about React components
- [ ] Understand props and state
- [ ] Build a simple counter app
- [ ] Read about the Virtual DOM

## Resources I Found Helpful

- [React Official Documentation](https://react.dev)
- [Next.js Learn Course](https://nextjs.org/learn)
- [freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/freecodecamp)

## Reflection

Today was encouraging! Setting up my environment took longer than expected, but I feel ready to start building. The coding community is incredibly welcoming, and I'm grateful for all the free resources available.
